4. Run thesiscode.m.
5. Countercheck with results.mat. Note that the results may vary slightly.

The code thesiscode.m contains the following main functions:
1. MeanVar - for Mean-Variance Model
2. MeanSemivar - for Mean-Semivariance Model
3. Naive - for Equally-weighted Model
5. MVSK - for MVSK via PGP Model
